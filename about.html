            I enjoy ...
        </h3>

        <h4> Walking</h4>
        <section>
        <p> Walking not only gives me an opportunity to enjoy some sunlight,
            but it is also a way to get some steps in and participate in
            a form of physical activity. Walking is also a form of relaxation for me
            - as I often listen to music while walking.
        </p>

        <h4>Spending Time with Family & Friends</h4>
        <p>No matter what activity is being done, whether it be stereotypically
            "boring" or fun, it is much more enyoable when done with
            family or friends. One of my favorite things to do
            is talking with others and hearing about different ideas
            and perspectives.

        <h4>Creating Memories with My Daughter</h4>
        <p> I cherish spending time with my daughter and creating
            lifetime memories. I use this time to not only engage in play,
            but to also teach every day lessons that she can use in the
            future.
