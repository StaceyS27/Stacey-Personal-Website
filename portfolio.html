        <h3>Things I have Built..</h3>

        <section>
            <h4>Zoo Problem</h4>
            <div class="detailAndImage">
                <p>For this project, we practiced important HTML concepts
                    such as the use of headings, semantic tags, and making ordered lists.
                    Additionally, we practiced inserting photos and external links to our
                    HTML files. With the use of these topics, we created a webpage for new
                    zookeepers so that they may familiarize themselves with the different animals
                    and learn more about them.
                </p>

        </section>

        <section>
            <h4>Grocery List</h4>
            <div class="detailAndImage">
                <img src="../../personal website extras/grocery list screenshot.jpeg">
                <p id="diffPara">For this project, we again practiced the use of different HTML tags, including
                    unordered and
                    ordered lists. Additionally, semantic tags were used to create sections for the
                    different types of food items to be purchased. Unlike the Zoo Problem project, howevever, CSS
                    styling
                    was added and linked to the HTML file. Properties such as font and background color were applied.
                    The box
                    model
                    was also used to add borders and spacing between sections.

        </section>

        <section>
            <h4>Secure the Vault</h4>
            <div class="detailAndImage">
            <p>Lastly, for this project, we began our practice of JavaScript. We created variables that would hold the
                value of the resulting arithmetic and with that, also practiced using the different artihmetic operators. The
                variable values had to be equal to one of the codes provided. The goal was to display an alert message on a webpage which
                would inform webpage visitors of the 3 codes. The message was created using the alert function, 
                which took in variable and strings in order to create its output - the message with the secret combination.
